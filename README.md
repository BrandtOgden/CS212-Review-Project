# CS212-Review-Project
**Ryan Shilling, Ryan Brooks, Jake Dansereau, Brandt Ogden**

## Summary 
For this project we created a program that can take in different grades and 
assignments from an input file that are from CS 212 and allow the user to do 
different things with those grades, like calculating and displaying their final 
grade, editing, removing, and creating different assignments, along with lots of 
other features.

## Planning 
In our first planning session we outlined the different functions that we were 
going to need in our class along with the different private variables we would 
need, and started to think about how these functions would be working.

During this planning session we divided who would do the different functions.
Brandt worked on the constructor for the gradebook which took input from a file
and put it into the private vectors associated with the GradeBook class. He also 
worked on the get_individual_grade function along with the corresponding
options in main. Jake worked on the get_category_grade and get_total_grade 
functions along with the corresponding options in main. Ryan Shilling worked 
on the edit functions that allow the user to edit different grades and completion
status along with the corresponding options in main. Ryan Brooks wrote the 
outline for main (you can see this in the comments at the top of main.cpp) and 
did most of the miscellaneous work on it that didn't fit into anyone else's role,
including the ability to remove an assignment.

## Compilation Instructions
To be completed

## Runtime Instructions 
During runtime different options will be shown to allow you to do different things 
with the grades in the text file. It will explain exactly what your options are and
what you need to type. All the inputs are "idiot-proofed" and will not allow you
to continue until you give a valid input. Different examples of inputs are shown in 
the next section.
