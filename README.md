# CS212-Review-Project
**Ryan Shilling, Ryan Brooks, Jake Dansereau, Brandt Ogden**

## Summary 
For this project we created a program that can take in different grades and 
assignments from an input file that are from CS 212 and allow the user to do 
different things with those grades, like calculating and displaying their final 
grade, editing, removing, and creating different assignments, along with lots of 
other features.
